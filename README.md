ðŸš€ Seasoned Engineer | Software Architecture ðŸš§ Data Engineering

Passion for architecting scalable data platforms and operationalizing machine learning systems in production. 
I thrive at the intersection of software engineering and data engineering, bridging the gap between complex backend infrastructure and intelligent, data-driven solutions.

I bring deep experience in building distributed systems, designing real-time and batch data pipelines, and deploying ML models at scale. 
I focus on delivering robust, maintainable systems that transform raw data into actionable insightsâ€”empowering business and product decisions.
